Problems I had during this project:
At the start I didn't know anything about Bootstrap. I mistakenly tried to use version 4.0 commands.
This page really helped me get started:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/

After I finished all the HTML, the JavaScript file was the hardest part of making this project work.
The most annoying issue was the cookies not working properly and expiring every time I closed the browser. However, after doing some research, I realized that I needed to set an expiration time for them.
